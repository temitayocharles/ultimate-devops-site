    <h1>Welcome to the Ultimate DevOps Container</h1>
    <p>
      Imagine you just bought a new laptop. You're excited to get started. But reality hits — Docker, Git, Terraform, AWS CLI, Helm... you have to install everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The internet is slow. Your disk is limited. The configurations are messy.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if you could bypass all that with a single container — preloaded, hardened, and ready to deploy your entire DevOps stack in seconds?
    </p>
    <p>
      Introducing the <strong>Ultimate DevOps Container</strong>: a powerful, secure, and fully-featured development environment — with built-in dashboards, monitoring, code server, secrets, CLI tools, and TLS — ready to run anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your stack. Your control. Instant power.
